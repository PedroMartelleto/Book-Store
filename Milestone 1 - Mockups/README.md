## Project Description

The goal of the project is to fulfill the [Requirements](requirements) by developing an easy-to-use online store that uses the [Goodreads book database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/goodreads-books) to present a catalog of books to the user. Several pages are presented in the website that implement the functionality described in the [Requirements](requirements). A **Navigation Diagram** illustrating the interaction between those pages can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xTA8quNUIcFnJdaKB3LAgx/Navigation-Diagram?node-id=0%3A1). To prepare for the development of the frontend, we developed a [Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/ZpRNOgvVlgQQf5CxK1sVEg/Book-Store---Mockup?node-id=0%3A1) with details of the widgets present in each page.
